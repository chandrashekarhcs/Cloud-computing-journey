# Welcome to the Cloud-computing-journey!

Cloud Computing is just delivering in demand IT resources over the internet
With cloud computing, you can stop thinking of infrastructure as hardware and instead think of it (and use it) as software.

In simpler words, Imagine you have a computer at home. This computer has all your games, pictures, and documents on it. 
Now, what if you could use a computer that's not at your home? That's what the "cloud" is â€“ it's like a special set of computers, but they're not in your house; they're somewhere else. 

With cloud computing, you can do things on these special computers in the cloud. You can play games, save pictures, and work on your documents, just like you do on your home computer. 
The cool part is, you can access these special computers from any regular computer, tablet, or even your phone, as long as you're connected to the internet. So, cloud computing is like using a computer that's not in your house, and it makes it easy for you to do things on the internet from wherever you are!

The most notable benefits are:
1. Pay as you Go
